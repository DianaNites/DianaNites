# Hello!

I'm Diana, I program primarily in the Rust Programming language and enjoy working on stuff like bootloaders, Operating Systems, Partition managers, Operating Systems again, Embedded, Systems in general.

Almost all my projects are open-source, though *please* keep in mind they are, for the most part, personal hobby projects that I'm *sharing*.

I can be contacted at \<github username> @ gmail
